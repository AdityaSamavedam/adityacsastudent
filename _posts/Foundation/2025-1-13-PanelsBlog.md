# Notes:
- communication is key, don't be afraid to open up
- talk to a lot of people to gain communication skills and make them recognize your skills
- talk like a techie, try to show the person you're talking with that you have knowledge in the subject
- in internships and jobs, they focus on experience, so it is crucial to have a lot of experience
- be broad-minded in general
- don't shy away, you miss opportunities that way
- focus on the most important things in your resume, that helps you stand out
- meet up with the right people to kickstart your career

# Things I should do:
- network more actively with peers in CS and STEM
- start opening up, don't be shy
- build professional contacts
- build my own website to showcase achievements
- practice building resumes so that it will be easy in the future
- seek out for opportunities like research and internships
