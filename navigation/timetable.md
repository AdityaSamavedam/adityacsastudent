# **Computer Science A**
<br>
<br>

## **Sprint1: Tools and Software Development Processes**
Students should have experience in blogging, coding with Jupyter Notebooks, and GitHub Pages. Understanding of Linux, Python, Markdown, HTML, and JavaScript is expected. Students have previously established a foundation using essential tools and software development processes. Weeks 0-2 will provide a quick review, prior to students starting their College Board CSA and Full Stack Web Development with Java journey.

## **Sprint2: Java Mini-labs**
Students should have an understanding of Fundamentals of Programming from Python, JavaScript, or other backgrounds. In this Sprint, students will become familiar with Java types, booleans, iteration, recursion, using and writing objects through Mini-labs. These labs will introduce AP required aspects of Java, FRQ requirements, and review College Board's 10 Sprints online.

## **Sprint3: Individual/Team Projects, N@tM**
In this Sprint, students will continue to become familiar with Java development as they learn Web Development using the Spring Framework. Coding will focus on Restful APIs, receiving requests, working with data, and responding to requests. This will teach key Java concepts while using Java Spring framework elements such as a Rest Controller, Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs), Object Relational Model (ORM), and Java Persistent API (JPA).
