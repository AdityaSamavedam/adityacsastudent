| Beyond Perfunctory         |   1           |   0.93        |  We uniquely set up three stations to teach and after each round was done, people would rotate. I did 6.1, Nitin did 6.2, and Akhil and Srini did 6.3 and 6.4 together. This was more effective than speaking directly to the whole audience.           |
