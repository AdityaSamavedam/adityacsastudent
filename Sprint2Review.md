| Beyond Perfunctory         |   1           |   0.93        |  We uniquely set up three stations to teach and after each round was done, people would rotate. I did 6.1, Nitin did 6.2, and Akhil and Srini did 6.3 and 6.4 together. This was more effective than speaking directly to the whole audience.           | 
| Total                      |   5           |    4.52       |              |

### Memories from our team teach:
- Initially, I felt that I was weak at teamwork but working with my group to create our lesson helped me improve my teamwork skills by a great extent, which is crucial in the long run
- I had a lot of fun collaborating with my teammates and creating our Arrays lesson
- Since we used our unique rotation teaching system, it got a little tiring when each of us had to teach thrice for 20 minutes each but each time, I was more prepared.
### Memories from Unit 5 team teach:
- We all felt that the lesson was too lengthy with too many popcorn hacks and too much work
- But I highly appreciate their group for making it Minion-themed, which helped me understand classes better.
- It definitely made the lesson much more fun and niteractive

            <p> - Inheritance Basics: Allows subclass to inherit properties and behaviors from superclass; promotes code reuse.
                - Superclass: Parent class; provides attributes and methods to subclasses.
                - Subclass: Inherits from superclass; can extend or override methods, add new attributes.
                - Method Overriding: Subclass modifies inherited methods from the superclass.
                - Polymorphism: Subclass objects treated as superclass instances; dynamic method calls at runtime.
                - super Keyword: Refers to superclass; used to access superclass constructor or overridden methods.
                - Object Class: Root of Java class hierarchy; all classes inherit from it.
                - Class Hierarchies: Multi-level inheritance creates complex class relationships.
                - Overriding vs Overloading: Overriding changes method behavior in subclass; overloading uses same method name with different parameters.</p>
